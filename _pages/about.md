I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical Engineering at National Tsing Hua University (NTHU)](https://web.ee.nthu.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=en), advised by Prof. [Chia-Wen Lin](https://www.ee.nthu.edu.tw/cwlin/) from NTHU and Prof. [Yen-Yu Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/yylinweb/) from NYCU. 

My research interests lie in Deep Learning and Computer Vision, particularly in image and video restoration tasks. I have published several papers in top-tier computer vision conferences and journals such as CVPR, ECCV, and TIP.
