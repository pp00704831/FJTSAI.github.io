I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), advised by Prof. Chia-Wen Lin from NTHU and Prof. Yen-Yu Lin from NYCU. My research interests lie in Deep Learning and Computer Vision, particularly in image and video restoration tasks such as deblurring and dehazing. I have published several papers in top-tier computer vision conferences and journals such as CVPR, ECCV, and TIP.
